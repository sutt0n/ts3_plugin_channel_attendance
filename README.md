ts3_plugin_channel_attendance
=============================

A TS3 Plugin I created for someone to take attendance in a channel, and sends HTTP POST Request with POST data via Winsock.

This is pretty much my first real, solid, bug-free use of sockets. Not expecting much to come from this.

Also, this expects you to pretty much have TS3 installed and you can place this project in your C:/.../ts3_root/pluginsdk/ folder.

Changelog
=========

- 1.0 Initial creation (no socket)
- 1.1 Added icon
- 1.2 Implemented socket/HTTP POST request
